# Roadmap

What this project is for, what is next, and — just as usefully — what it will
never do. Dates are deliberately absent; the ordering is the commitment.

The measure for every item below is the same one the tool applies to itself: a
claim that cannot be traced to the code is a bug, not a feature. Anything that
would make nunki confident about something it has not read does not ship,
however useful it sounds.

## Shipped

| | |
|---|---|
| **0.1** | The architecture book: containers, relationships, C4 depths, typed `DiagramIR`, deterministic layout, interactive HTML |
| **0.2** | Behaviour: API contracts, request-flow sequences, data model and lifecycles, functional spec and BRD scaffold, capability and domain splits, runtime topology |
| | Evidence pinned to a commit and verified against it; `check` fails CI on drift |
| | MCP server on stdio, for agents |
| | Prebuilt binaries for five targets, an installer, and a GitHub Action |
| | `diff` — what two revisions disagree about, as a PR comment |
| | `export --format drawio` — the diagram, with its evidence, in a tool you can edit |
| **0.4** | A book states how much of the source it read, and refuses below a tenth |
| | C# and ASP.NET Core: attribute routes, EF Core entities, `.csproj` modules |
| | `comment: true` — the action keeps one diff comment per pull request |
| | On the Marketplace as [Nunki Architecture Docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nunki-architecture-docs) |
| | Authored prose can be pinned to evidence; `check` reports it when it rots |
| | Specs in OpenSpec's shape, and `conform` — what a spec someone else wrote does and does not match |
| | `history.json` — what each release changed, recorded when it was cut |
| | `[workspace] members` — one book for a system spread over several repositories, each citation naming and verified in the repository it came from |

Languages read today: Rust, TypeScript/TSX, Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, C#.

## Tracked work

Every item below is an issue, so progress is visible without reading this file.
**[Board](https://github.com/users/sadaramk/projects/3)** ·
[Open issues](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues) ·
[0.4.0](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/milestone/1) ·
[1.0](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/milestone/2)

On the board, *Blocked* means waiting on a decision or on someone outside the
repository — not on effort.

### 0.4.0 — shipped

| | |
|---|---|
| [#1](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/1) | Qualify or refuse a book built from a small fraction of a repository |
| [#2](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/2) | Read C# |
| [#3](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/3) | Post `diff` as a PR comment out of the box |
| [#4](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/4) | Containers keeps its datastore edges; two boxes are joined by one connector |
| [#10](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/10) | Publish the action to the GitHub Marketplace |

### What is next

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [#53](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/53) | Document what a CLI can do. nunki's own book proves its dependency graph and cannot say what the tool does, because behaviour is modelled as HTTP operations and a CLI has none. `clap`'s derive declarations are the same kind of structured, citable contract a route table is. |

It came out of reading nunki's own published book rather than from a plan, which
is the sort of item worth trusting. [#20](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/20)
(architecture history) and [#21](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/21) (a
system spread over several repositories) cleared the queue before it.
#21 kept its constraint: a citation into a sibling repository is verified in that
repository at that repository's commit, and one naming a repository nothing read
is reported rather than checked against whatever sits at those lines here.

What remains are **[#8](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/8) and
[#9](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/9), which are clocks rather than
tasks**: both promise a surface *unchanged for a full minor cycle*, which no
amount of work completes — only elapsed time without a violation does.

Their other acceptance criteria are met, and were checked rather than assumed.
The schema ships as a release asset (`release.yml`); the deprecation path is
written down (CONTRIBUTING.md); the exit codes are documented
(`README.md`) and asserted in journeys — `2` at `journeys.rs:80`, `1` at
`:156` and `:184`, `0` throughout.

**Where the clocks stand, measured 2026-09-25.** Both baselines were frozen on
2026-09-21 at v0.4.1, and v0.5.0 shipped on 2026-09-23, so one minor cycle has
elapsed under them:

- `DiagramIR` has changed exactly once against the frozen 0.4 baseline — one
  property added, `Evidence.repo`, for multi-repository citations. Nothing
  removed, nothing retyped, nothing made required.
- The CLI surface has changed shape twice, both additions, both on 2026-09-22:
  `--spec` on `conform` and `--record` on `diff`. Nothing has ever been removed
  or renamed. The help-text rewrite on 2026-09-24 changed no flag.

The promise has held, and it is now enforced on both sides rather than on one:
`crates/cli/tests/stability.rs` refuses a breaking CLI change the way
`crates/ir-spec/tests/stability.rs` refuses a breaking schema change. Until it
existed, the CLI half was enforced by whoever read the diff — and a release
that only reworded help produced a 34-line diff there, indistinguishable at a
glance from a renamed flag.

**Both stay open, and not because the work is unfinished.** Read as a version
interval the criteria are already met: the baselines were frozen during 0.4 and
0.5.0 shipped two days later with nothing removed. But that interval is what a
*full minor cycle* is a proxy for, and the thing it stands in for has not
happened. This repository was 10 days old when 0.5.0 shipped; it has no stars,
no forks, and every issue not opened by its author was opened by dependabot.
The release download counts are its own CI, which fetches the last release on
every pull request.

So two days of nobody needing to change the surface, while nobody was using it,
is not evidence that it is settled — and #8 says what the promise is for in as
many words: *a consumer can write against the schema and not have it shift
underneath them*. No consumer has written against it. **The clock to watch is
the first outside user, not the calendar**; a week of solo use cannot falsify
the promise however long it runs. Closing these on elapsed time would be
claiming a guarantee nothing has tested, which is the failure mode this whole
project is an argument against.

## Not doing

These are not backlog items. They are decisions, and the reasoning matters more
than the list.

- **A parsed-fact cache.** Measured before building, on five large
  repositories: a complete, fully verified book takes 0.3 s on etcd and 9.4 s
  on kubernetes — 8,167 files and 1.8 million lines, where `git clone` alone
  takes minutes. The premise was right that `check` re-parses everything every
  run; the cost was not. A cache would buy a few seconds and introduce the one
  failure this project exists to prevent, a stale entry producing a book that
  looks correct. If it ever does become painful the answer is to parallelise
  the behaviour phase — parsing already is — which needs the same restructure
  without the staleness. ([#5](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/5))

- **Shrinking what an agent pays to have nunki connected.** Measured
  2026-09-25: the MCP server publishes 4 tools costing 9,454 characters,
  ~2,363 tokens, loaded into every request whether or not a tool is ever
  called — MCP has no way to hide a tool until it is named, so this is a
  standing cost. Two thirds of it is one thing: `nunki_compile_diagram`'s
  `$defs`, the `DiagramIR` type graph inlined at 4,877 characters, against
  1,479 for all four descriptions together. Rewriting every sentence in the
  server would move under a sixth of the number.

  The inlined types are kept. They are why an agent can produce valid IR
  without a round trip, and replacing them with a pointer to `nunki schema`
  would buy context back by making the self-heal loop in journey 2 the common
  path instead of the exception — paying in correctness for a saving in
  tokens. What was wrong was not measuring it: the surface could have doubled
  and nothing would have said so. `nunki-mcp` now refuses a surface over
  12,000 characters, which leaves room for a fifth tool of ordinary size and
  none for a second inlined schema. Raising that ceiling is a decision to
  record here with its measurement, not a number to edit until a test passes.

  The book, the Markdown mirror and `llms.txt` are not part of this: they are
  read when something asks for them. `llms.txt` — the index an agent reads
  first — is 4,562 characters for the example book, and `llms-full.txt` is
  76,947. ([#59](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/59))

- **Following dispatch that happens at runtime.** Twice investigated, twice
  abandoned. A cross-unit expansion was built and reverted during 0.2 for
  changing nothing on five real repositories; instrumenting the code path
  later showed why, on five more — the function that resolves a port to its
  adapter runs zero times on eShopOnWeb, CleanArchitecture, nunki itself and
  the Spring Cloud fixture, and the multi-implementation case it is blamed for
  never fired once. Whatever limits a request flow is upstream of interface
  dispatch. If that changes, the approach is to read the dependency-injection
  registration — `AddScoped<IOrderService, OrderService>` is an ordinary
  citable line, and it names decorators a single-implementation guess gets
  wrong — not to search harder.
  ([#6](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/6))

- **Prose written by a language model.** The entire value here is that a claim
  can be traced to a line of code. Generated narrative cannot be, and mixing the
  two makes the verifiable parts untrustworthy by association.
- **A hosted service.** The book is files you commit next to the code. A server
  in the middle adds an outage, an account and a bill to something that works
  offline.
- **A diagram editor.** draw.io is a good editor and this is not one. Export is
  one way on purpose: the source stays authoritative about the architecture.
- **An architecture rule engine.** "No module may import X" is a linter's job,
  and there are good ones. Documenting what is true is a different problem from
  enforcing what should be.
- **Runtime or OpenTelemetry tracing.** A different kind of evidence, needing a
  running system, a collector and a retention policy. It would also make the
  output non-reproducible, which `check` depends on.
- **A developer portal.** Backstage exists.

## What 1.0 means

Not a feature count. Three things have to be true:

1. **[`DiagramIR` is stable](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/8).** The
   schema is versioned and the TypeScript mirror is a contract test, but fields
   still move between minor versions.
2. **[The CLI surface is stable](https://github.com/sadaramk/nunki/issues/9).**
   Subcommands and flags stop changing shape.
3. **No known case where the book states something the code does not support.**
   Every such case found so far became a fix and a regression fixture; the bar
   for 1.0 is that the list is empty, not short. The findings are in
   [HEURISTICS.md](HEURISTICS.md).
